# Recommended conda environment for Intel Mac:
#
# 1) Create env with core libs via conda:
#    conda create -n graspmesh-env \
#        python=3.10 \
#        numpy=1.26.4 \
#        opencv \
#        -c conda-forge
#
# 2) Activate the environment:
#    conda activate graspmesh-env
#
# 3) Install the remaining packages (mediapipe) with pip:
#    pip install -r requirements_graspmesh.txt  (recommend to just install mediapipe alone after creating the env with the other libs)
#
# 4) Run the script:
#    python Grasp_Mesh.py --camera-index 0  (you only need to add the camera index if you want one specifically; otherwise just run it)

mediapipe==0.10.21
numpy==1.26.4
opencv-python==4.10.0.84
